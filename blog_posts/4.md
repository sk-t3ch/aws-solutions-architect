# AWS Solutions Architect Quiz 4üéì (SQS, SNS)

The AWS solutions architect certification shows that you can use AWS services to solve software engineering problems and understand core best practices of the industry. In this article, I will quiz you on two sections from the material required for the exam: SQS and SNS.

I will now briefly state some key facts about each AWS service and then provide some example questions for the exam.

N.B: The following information on its own will not be enough to answer the questions.

### [SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html)

The Simple Queue Service is a fully managed queue service. It is key to building distributed and scalable systems by enabling services to be decoupled.

It is also useful to know:

* Each messages on the queue have a globally unique Id.

* Messages can have medata ‚Äî process without processing all message.

* The queue is accessible via a DNS name.

* There is a maximum of 120,000 in flight messages on a single queue.

* A queue can have multiple readers.

* Delay queue is used to postpone delivery of new messages.

* Visibility timeouts define how long a message is available once retrieved from queue: 12 hour max ‚Äî 30 second default.

* The API features long polling for message ‚Äî 20 second max.

* Dead letter queues are used for storing failed processing from another queue.

### [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns)

The Simple Notification Service is a fully managed messaging service. It can also be used to decouple systems but instead pushes messages to consumers without guarantee it has been read.

It is also useful to know:

* Messages are published to topics and subscribers of those topics will be sent the message.

* Works with HTTP, HTTPS, SMS, email, email-JSON, Amazon SQS, and AWS Lambda.

* The API features the ability to poll for messages.

* The Fanout feature allows users to push messages to multiple subscribers.
