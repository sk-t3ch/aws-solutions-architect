# AWS Solutions Architect Quiz 6 üéì (IAM)

The AWS solutions architect certification shows that you can use AWS services to solve software engineering problems and understand core best practices of the industry. In this article, I will quiz you on one of the sections from the material required for the exam: IAM.

I will now briefly state some key facts about this AWS service, and then provide some example questions for the exam.

N.B: The following information on its own will not be enough to answer the questions.

### IAM

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service enables authorisation and authentication on AWS resources.

**Authentication** ‚Äî *are you who you claim to be?*

**Authorisation** ‚Äî *are you allowed to do what you want to do?*

It is also useful to know that:

* The top level user is called a ***principal*** and is allowed to interact with AWS resources ‚Äî Root user, IAM user, and Roles are principles.

* **A Root user** is created when the AWS account is created and has console and programmatic access.

* **IAM users + groups** ‚Äî persistent identities that can be controlled through IAM. IAM user must have the rights to assume the role.

* **Roles ‚Äî** allow people or processes the ability to operate temporarily with a different identity. Assume a role by being granted a temporary security token.

* A **policy** is a JSON document that defines one or more permissions to interact with AWS resources. Each permission includes: Effect, Action and Resource.

* You can write your own policies or use one of the [managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html) provided by AWS.

* IAM enables rotation by allowing two active access keys.
